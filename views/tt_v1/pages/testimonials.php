	<p>&ldquo;Two calloused thumbs way up! &nbsp;I took the rock climbing course here a few months and have been hooked
		ever since. &nbsp;It's an incredible workout and a great group-building exercise to do with friends/co-workers.
		&nbsp;I wish I could remember the names of our instructors, but I definitely felt safe several stories up with
		these rugged and knowledgeable sherpas at the base.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;I took the beginning rock climbing course at Pinnacles last weekend and it was awesome! &nbsp;My wife had
		bought a Groupon and gave it to me as a gift. &nbsp;Honestly, I was a little worried that the class would be too
		basic as I've done a lot of indoor climbing and took the basics class at Yosemite Mountain School. &nbsp;But,
		the instructor, Brandon, tailored the class to each of our abilities. &nbsp;The climb that he put us on at
		Teaching Rock was great because we were able to try different routes with varying difficulty. &nbsp;Brandon was
		a fantastic instructor- personable, encouraging and clearly competent. &nbsp;If you have been wanting to learn
		to climb, this is the way to go.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much for a great experience! And thank you Daniel for being a great teacher!&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Brandon was awesome guy. He tailored the class to each person's comfort level. I had a lot of fun and will
		definitely be going back.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;I took a beginner rock climbing class with friends recently. We had such a great time I was inspired to
		write my first yelp review.&nbsp;</p>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;When we arrived (a tad late but they were super gracious) Daniel was waiting with clean sturdy climbing
		gear. &nbsp;Jakob and Paul had gone on ahead to make sure we had a good space on this understandably popular
		climbing rock (great for beginners and the views are breathtaking!). &nbsp;Daniel was our primary instructor and
		he was knowledgeable, patient and just generally a great teacher. Though they thoughtfully recommended we bring
		water and snacks to sustain ourselves through a morning of climbing in the sun, we didn't. &nbsp;No worries,
		'cause they brought water and snacks to share!</p>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;All three of our guides were a ton of fun, very friendly and knowledgeable. They are also all very cool-I
		understand they do horseback trips and sailing in addition to rock climbing.</p>
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;Every single one of you who made it far enough to read this review needs to take a climbing lesson or go
		on an awesome trip with these folks (I'm jealous)!&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Awesome introduction to rock climbing, great guides, super professional and safe, and most of all, fun! I
		plan to go back for more rock climbing courses with them.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Our Treks and Tracks guides were fabulous! They were incredibly knowledgeable and skilled, super nice and
		friendly, and very helpful in instructing me about rock climbing. I had a great experience and would definitely
		go back. Also, they provided all of the gear, including shoes, which was great.&rdquo;</p>
	<span>October 26, 2011</span>

	<p>&ldquo;The guides were great! Both helpful on what to expect during the climb, while also giving each of us in
		the group confidence to climb as newbies to outdoor climbing. My first experience was AWESOME!! I would
		definitely go back to treks and tracks for another outdoor climbing adventure!&rdquo;</p>
	<span>October 26, 2011</span>

	<p>&ldquo;The knowledge and general friendliness of the instructor exceeded my expectations. I would definitely
		recommend Treks and Tracks.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;I took a lead climbing class with Daniel about a year ago in San Francisco. He is incredibly
		knowledgeable, patient, approachable, positive, kind, and experienced. Not only does he know his stuff, he
		actually knows how to TEACH it to other people. It's rare to find instructors that can intelligently transfer
		knowledge to their students. Highly recommend a T&T class.&rdquo;
	<p>&ldquo;I just got back from a 7 day adventure horseback ride/camp/hike in Colorado with these guys and it was
		phenomenal. Definitely challenging, but worth every sec. These trips are just going to keep getting better and
		better. While not for a person who has never been camping or been on a horse, it will excite those that love to
		camp and have some experience on horses. I am looking forward to the next adventure.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;My daughter was on the 3-day (Aug 16-18 2010) rock climbing in Castle Rock State Park and she thoroughly
		enjoyed it. The first day she got acquainted with bouldering and day 2 and 3 top roping and rappelling. My
		daughter liked Goat Rock especially the 'Swiss Cheese' route but her favorite was Indian rock. The instructor
		was very knowledgeable (he has climbed El Capitan!), safety conscious and friendly. I recommend this climbing
		camp to anyone who has a child interested in learning the basics of climbing.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;My daughter was in the 3-day rock climbing class and enjoyed the small group size (which meant she was
		able to do lots of climbing) and the supportive leader that taught her a lot. She highly recommends the camp,
		and as a parent, I do too!&rdquo;</p>
